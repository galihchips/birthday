I’ve waited for that smile for so long
Do you really love me?
'Cause I don’t think I'm where I belong
All the time we spent alone is part of my dreams
I can't believe I pulled you
You’re out of my league

A whole day with you is enough
Oh, but now we have forever
Please don’t change
As we growin’ up I hope you won’t change
Please don’t forget what we put in our plans
In this world just you and me till' the end

'Cause I won’t change
As my hair turns white I will stay the same
Whenever you need me
Oh, I will be there
'Cause now or forever I swear I won’t change

Where have you been?
I’ve struggled with heartbreaks for years and got nothin’
But I know this time you're the one
Oh, I know you won’t let me go

All the night we spent alone is part of my dreams
I can't believe I got you
You’re out of my league

A whole day with you is never enough
But we have forever
Please don’t change
As we growin’ up I hope you won’t change
Please don’t forget what we put in our plans
In this world just you and me till’ the end

'Cause I won’t change
As my hair turns white I will stay the same
Whenever you need me
Oh, I will be there
'Cause now or forever I swear I won’t change

Please don’t change
As we growin’ up I hope you won’t change
Please don’t forget what we put in our plans
In this world just you and me till’ the end

'Cause I won’t change
As my hair turns white I will stay the same
When we turned 80 we’d still holdin’ hands
You’re my whole world
Oh, I swear it won’t change
Change`}
